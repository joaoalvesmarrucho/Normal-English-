# Normal (English)
Chrome extension useful to read some texts and identify hidden systemic racism. Turns "aboriginal", "asian", "black", "caucasian", "gipsy", "irish", "latino", "white", "romani" and other terms to define ethnicities into "normal". Leave a comment if you want to add your own race/ethnicity and we will try to add it to the Chrome Extension as soon as possible.

# Acknowledging Issues
## The word "Normal"
We have considered using the another word instead of "Normal" but for now it seems like the reasons for using "Normal" outwheight the reasons not to.
Alternative outputs: "Undefined", "Person", " "(empty string so that "White people" becomes just "people")
Pros: 
Readability: it doesn't interrupt the normal flow / It strengthens the idea we are all the same
Cons: 
It doesnâ€™t recognise the importance of the notion of diversity. 

## Plurals and Letter Case 
The content.js file holds the array of Key Pairs and needs manual input for all scenarios (plurals and different letter cases). We are sure both plural and smallcase/uppercase converstions could be automated. let us know if you  fix this please.
